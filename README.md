# Deck Script For Working via Steam Deck
This script will install some dev programs and temporarily disable the read-only filesystem so that you can work with terminal development tools. Note that this script was made from Desktop Mode on my personal Steam Deck plugged into a NexDock Touch.

## Usage
First, let's open up the Konsole from the Steam Deck application menu at the bottom left of Desktop mode. Then paste these commands to run the script:
```
git clone https://github.com/al12gamer/deckscript.git
cd deckscript
bash deckscript.sh
```
## Programs Installed
This Script will install the following programs:
Boxes (flatpak), vim, neofetch, btop++ (from git), Lutris (flatpak), base development packages, Brave browser (flatpak), Protonup-Qt (flatpak)
